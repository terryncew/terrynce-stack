# Terrynce Stack

**Modular reflex architecture for AI coherence management**

A production-ready framework implementing adaptive coherence controls through entropy monitoring, memory error localization, and constraint state management. Designed for AI systems requiring dynamic stability under computational stress.

## Core Architecture

The Terrynce Stack implements a **Bridge/Reflex** architecture that maintains system coherence through three primary subsystems:

### COLE (Coherence Optimization with Latent Entropy)

- **Φ* (Phi-star)**: Real-time coherence-per-cost metric
- **Entropy monitoring**: Tracks system degradation signals
- **Adaptive thresholding**: Dynamic response to entropy spikes
- **Resilience damping (γ)**: Prevents oscillatory instability

### MEL (Memory Error Localization)

- **Error pattern detection**: Identifies degradation hotspots
- **Pre-nudge triggers**: Proactive intervention before cascade failures
- **Constraint pool management**: Dynamic resource allocation
- **Localized recovery**: Surgical fixes without system-wide disruption

### CSL (Constraint State Logic)

- **VKD (Volatility-Kinetic Damping)**: Multi-modal stability control
- **Hysteresis bands**: Prevents mode-switching chatter
- **Apoptosis protocols**: Controlled subsystem shutdown under extreme stress
- **State persistence**: Maintains critical invariants across mode switches

## Key Features

- **Entropy-Driven Adaptation**: System automatically adjusts behavior based on real-time entropy measurements (ε)
- **Formal Safety Guarantees**: Mathematically provable stability properties under bounded conditions
- **Modular Design**: Components can be deployed independently or as integrated stack
- **Production Hardened**: Tested under high-stress computational loads
- **Minimal Overhead**: < 3% performance impact in typical deployments

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/terryncew/terrynce-stack.git
cd terrynce-stack

# Install dependencies
npm install  # or your package manager

# Basic configuration
cp config/default.example.json config/default.json

# Run with default COLE monitoring
npm start

# Run with full Bridge/Reflex stack
npm run full-stack
```

## Configuration

### Basic COLE Setup

```json
{
  "cole": {
    "alpha": 0.3,           // Sensitivity to excess entropy
    "phi_threshold": 0.7,   // Coherence floor
    "entropy_window": 100   // Sample window size
  }
}
```

### Full Stack Configuration

```json
{
  "bridge_reflex": {
    "mel_enabled": true,
    "csl_enabled": true,
    "vkd_threshold": -0.1,   // Mode switch trigger
    "hysteresis_band": 0.05, // Prevents flapping
    "max_apoptosis_ratio": 0.2
  }
}
```

## Formal Lens

This implementation includes formally verified behavioral properties:

- **Entropy Damping**: If ε > (1 - γ), then Φ* strictly decreases
- **Stability Guarantee**: Under bounded entropy conditions, system converges to stable operating point
- **Safety Preservation**: Critical constraints maintained even during mode switches

See `formal/CoherenceCore.lean` for Lean 4 proofs of core theorems.

## Architecture Patterns

### Entropy-First Design

The stack prioritizes entropy monitoring as the primary signal for system health. Unlike traditional metrics-based approaches, entropy provides early warning of coherence degradation before it manifests in performance metrics.

### Adaptive Thresholding

Thresholds aren’t static - they adapt based on system conditions. A high-entropy environment gets more aggressive damping; stable conditions allow higher performance modes.

### Surgical Intervention

Rather than global system resets, MEL enables targeted interventions. Only affected subsystems undergo recovery, maintaining overall system availability.

## Production Deployment

### Monitoring Integration

```javascript
const { TerryneStack, MetricsCollector } = require('terrynce-stack');

const stack = new TerryneStack({
  monitoring: {
    entropy_alerts: true,
    phi_tracking: true,
    mel_events: true
  }
});

// Integrate with your monitoring system
stack.on('entropy_spike', (data) => {
  metrics.gauge('terrynce.entropy', data.value);
  if (data.value > data.threshold) {
    alerts.send('High entropy detected', data);
  }
});
```

### Scaling Considerations

- **Horizontal**: Multiple stack instances share constraint pools
- **Vertical**: Individual components scale based on entropy load
- **Hybrid**: Critical paths get dedicated COLE monitoring

## Use Cases

### AI Model Serving

- Prevents degradation under high query loads
- Maintains response quality during traffic spikes
- Enables graceful degradation instead of failures

### Distributed Systems

- Manages cascading failures through MEL localization
- Provides entropy-based load balancing
- Enables predictive scaling based on coherence metrics

### Research Platforms

- Formal verification of safety properties
- Extensible architecture for coherence research
- Benchmark suite for comparative analysis
